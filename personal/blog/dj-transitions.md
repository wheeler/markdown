# DJ Transitions

Transition types to consider to revive your sets

1. Selection
1. Sequencing
1. Transition

These are the three things, in order of importance, that the DJ controls which have a major impact on an audience.

1. Presence
1. Effects / Samples / Tricks

These are minor things that a DJ can do to impact the experience of the audience.

1. Crowd
1. Sound\*
1. Scene

These are the three most important things that a DJ cannot control. (\* a DJ plays a part but is not the main part)

This blog post is going to focus on Transition, the technical important thing that all DJs do.

## One-Drop

What: At the end of a phrase on the outgoing track "drop" a hard transition to the incoming track putting the first beat of a phrase from the new song where.

Benefits: Doesn't require beatmatch. Can be used to change tempo (esp. increase)

## Intro-Outro

Probably the most standard/classic beatmix. Perfect for beginners and useful forever. Many dance music songs have an intro and an outro section - parts of the tracks that are more sparse or don't have some of the instrumentation. These are ideal places to transition because the sparseness makes the mix naturally not too busy. Mixing with the intro or outro also means you're using more of your tracks. One thing to take care about is intro-outro mixes can cause an undesired drop in energy. When the outro starts it's often a relaxation at the end of the track. If the incoming intro is long or starts very mellow you're going to have a lower energy spot in your mix. This is ok sometimes (or sometimes doesn't happen if the incoming track starts with lots of energy) but if you always intro-outro you're going to risk dropping energy a bit between every track.

## Breakdown swap (break-for-break)

This means transitioning with the breakdowns of the two tracks aligned. If done right this can result in an almost inaudible transition. Transitioning this way sometimes will add interest to your mix. Track breakdowns is written to give the listener renewed appetite for more of the same track but the listener will slowly realize they're getting something new instead!

How this works depends on how much rhythmic content there is in the breakdown. High energy bangers often drop the rhythm entirely at the beginning of a breakdown to give the dancers a deep breath of recovery. Having at least one track with no rhythmic content will make the transition the smoothest. It will sound best if the outgoing track is the one that has no rhythm. These work better with harmonic mixing but as always that is flexible depending on the tracks.

## Buildup swap / Buildup Transition / Drop swap

Some tracks have a buildup and drop sequence after a breakdown. Buildups are sometimes hectic rhythmically, with beats being increasingly subdivided as the drop approaches. These are great transition spots because the listener expects "lots of stuff going on" so the addition of extra sound from the incoming track doesn't sound out of place. These chunks of music often sound very different from the part that comes right before them, so doing a harder one-drop to the next track will feel much less out of place than at the end of some random measure.

I do all three flavors: one-drop the buildup, transition during the buildup, and one-drop the drop.

## Loops

## Other beatmixes

This means simply any other place where you align the songs and make a beatmix transition.

## Broad Tips

Know your music, know your audience.

- Room full of wild dancing energy-junkies?

  Favor faster mixes that hinge on energetic parts of the tracks.

- Room full of people who are listening intently and grooving mellowly?

  Favor longer melodic transitions to give them nuance.

## Technical Tips

- Match volume levels
- Control total output level
  - if you use a cross fader with a curve this is kind of taken care of for you
- Create space
- EQ-swap in a beatmix
  - This is an extreme version of "creating space", with the addition of a hard EQ transition. This often works best with the bass but can be awesome with any band depending on the track content. For bass - do a beatmix transition where both tracks have a bass beat, but bring the incoming track in with the bass EQ all the way down. With the new track fully in, wait for a new phrase and cut the outgoing bass EQ and put the incoming bass EQ to normal on one. Boom your blend of tracks suddenly has a new bass beat. This can be very energizing (esp. if the beat patterns are different). It also means that you won't have muddy or confusing beats (esp. useful if the beat patterns are different). Places where you might want to do this for non-bass EQ bands might be if there's a really distinct mid-melody or sound in both tracks, or distinct or strong high-hats in both tracks.
  - The tracks should still be beatmatched or the other elements will not sound right.
- Fake a breakdown
  - a high-pass filter or dropping the bass out of a track can make it sounds kind of like there's a breakdown, or at least that the track has stepped back a bit. Do this for a measure to a phrase before bringing in the next track to give it lots of space.
- Fake a track ending
- be VERY aware of where vocal content is in tracks
  - You almost always want to avoid overlapping - two people singing different things at the same time will clang almost all the time. Possible exceptions: vocals that are not words, vocals that are not phrases (ex. "yeah - yeah - yeah").
